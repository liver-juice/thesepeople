generate a random person.

full name, parents, location, career, age, pets, criminal history, owned assets.

randomly generate a human being on each click, start SIMPLE. name, age, career.

how? each person should obviously be an object right.

person[birthYear]

so every "person" is an instance of the person class, with its own reference name but how.

let person = {
    firstName = genFirstName;
    lastName = genLastName;
    name = firstName 
    gender = gender;
    age = age;
    career = career;
}



-- perhaps to turn into bitlife-like game later with generated characters.

so what do i want.
what i want. is when i press a button, i want it to generate a new person for me.
each person is an object, with a bunch of assets that are generated when its created.
